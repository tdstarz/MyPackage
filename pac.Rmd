# Introduction

This is my Rmd file of four functions from my package called MyPackage. These functions have been used in previous lab assignments to demonstrate my knowledge of R.


# First Function: Bins.R

This makes a histogram of the normal distribution from a sample size n.

```{r first}
MyPackage::mybin()
```


# Second Function: CI.R

This finds the default confidence interval for a 2 sample population if x is a random, single sample.

```{r second}

MyPackage::myci(x = rnorm(30, mean=10, sd=12))

```


# Third Function: CLT.R

This makes a histogram of a uniform sample distribution with x as the sample size.

```{r third}
MyPackage::myclt()
```


# Fourth Function: MaxLikelihood.R

This makes a plot of the maximum likelihood of a data set with param and x.

```{r fourth}
logbin=function(x,param) log(dbinom(x,prob=param,size=50))
MyPackage::mymaxlik(logbin,x=c(1,3,9,7,4,6,5,8),param=seq(0,1,length=1000),main="Maximum Likelihood, n=20")
```
